          This website displays a project made by the 2019 QMIND Music Team. To
          learn more about QMIND <a href="http://qmind.ca">click here</a>. The
          project is the accumulation of hours of hard work planning, designing,
          and programming by Queen's Students. The goal was to create a neural
          network capable of generating a song from an image. We did this by
          compiling 30 second audio clips as well as cover artwork from Spotify
          for 100 songs across multiple genres.

          After collecting our data sets, the team explored ways of converting
          the audio and images into useable formats for training. For audio, the
          melody was extracted from songs using the{" "}

            Melodia Algorithm
          </a>
          , and the result was turned into a MIDI file. For images, the{" "}

            KAZE Algorithm
          </a>{" "}
          was used for feature extraction, specifically detecting edges and
          shapes within the album artwork. The image and music data was used to
          train an LSTM Neural Network (largely based on{" "}

          ). When the trained network is fit with image data, the ouptut is then
          converted back into a .WAV file, check out the section{" "}
