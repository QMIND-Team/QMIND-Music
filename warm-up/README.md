# Warm Up

The warm up project created by the QMIND Music Team in the fall semester of the 2018-2019 school year! This project acted as an introduction to Python, Machine Learning and problem-solving to prepare for the [main project!](./main-project) For our warm up project we created a Decision Tree Classifier using [Sci-kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org) that was able to differentiate between happy and sad songs. We used [Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) to collect a rich data set of happy and sad songs, and tested the accuracy of our classifiers using split testing with the collected data.

## Usage
