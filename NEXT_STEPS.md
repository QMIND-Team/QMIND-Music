# Next Steps

## Joey

We have done some really cool stuff this year and I am really proud of everything the team has accomplished. That being said, we now have a great foundation for exploring new things and improving existing aspects of the project. Here is a summary:

- **Diving deeper into neural networks**

We have a functioning neural network and a good baseline understanding of how it works. However, there is room for improvement in understanding what's actually going on in the individual layers of the neural net.

- **Experiment with different models**

It would be cool to try out a few different models and seeing which performs best. It would also be cool to try some models more closely related to the [original](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5?gi=26f1e5833f85) that compare sequences of notes with following ones.

- **Transfer Learning**

It would be cool to experiment with transfer learning and see how we can use it in this context!
