## Next Steps
#### Jill Bennett (Data Science)

- Researching how differing sets of training data effect the outcome (ex. changing genre, specific artists, etc.)
- In general, finding a way for us to predict/direct some qualities of the outputted songs
- Looking into creating a larger database of images/songs to work with
- Better results through looking at album artwork vs. single artwork (might have stronger correlation between songs released as a single, than just songs pulled from a full-length album)
- Researching how using different sizes/resolution of images effect the songs
- Researching how different lengths of songs effect the outcome of the generated music
- Would analyzing images using object identification as well as point-of-interest identifiction increase the correlation between songs and images?

*Personal Goals:*
- Understanding on a deeper level the code actually involved in making the LSTM (how it works)
- Being able to apply the general framework of this project to other situations
